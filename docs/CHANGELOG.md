## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-27

First post-hackathon release: the codebase is pruned to exactly the components that
ship in the deployed Hugging Face Space.

### Removed
- **Superlinked retrieval** (`src/retrieve.py`, `[retrieval]` extra, `retrieve_context` node) — was excluded from the Docker image and lazy-imported behind a graceful fallback, so it never ran in the deployed app.
- **n8n workflow** (`workflows/noteguard.n8n.json`) — a three-node proxy to NoteGuard's own REST API; off the runtime path.

### Changed
- **Faithfulness judge** now scores the answer against the de-identified source note (`deid_text`) instead of retrieved context, so it produces a live number in the deployed app and matches `eval/run_eval.py`.
- `agent/graph.py` pipeline simplified to `deidentify_in → agent → reidentify_out → compute_trust`; `build_graph()` drops the `note_index` argument.
- `Makefile` modernised to the real toolchain (`pip install -e .`, `ruff`, `src` package).
- `pyproject.toml` / `VERSION` bumped to `1.0.0`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Four-fix person-name leak** — GMC/NMC connector-word patterns (`NMC number: ...`, `PIN ...`, `GMC No. ...`); Presidio + spaCy `_Detector` interface (graceful no-op fallback); `load_known_from_csv` extended to pull clinician names from `admissions.csv`; `residual_identifiers()` catches orphaned `[LABEL_n]` tokens; `assert_clean()` now covers NMC patterns.
- **`{{PATIENT}}` placeholder** — patient name resolved from `patients.csv` via `person_id`; model never writes or sees a real name in the title.
- **Leaked-token trust panel** — `leaked_tokens` propagated through `compute_trust` → API → UI; `residual_risk > 0` when any leak is detected; detail panel in the clinician UI.
- **Note picker modal** — `/samples` API with search, `note_type` filter, shuffle, and row-click load; built-in fallback when dataset absent.
- **Compact eDischarge card** — four-element format (patient · narrative · follow-up · grounded); `renderSummary()` styles each element; `Grounded:` line omitted when Tavily returns nothing.
- **Word-boundary fix in `_residual_known`** — prevents false 422s from short vault names matching inside clinical words (e.g. `Dia` in `Diastolic`).
- **Gold RAP structure** — `noteguard/` renamed to `src/`; `pyproject.toml` is the single dependency source; `requirements.txt` removed; `outputs/` directory added.
- **Streamlit demo** — `streamlit_app.py` at repo root for interactive de-id demonstration without API keys.
- **Governance docs** — `docs/tool_card.md` (Five Safes, bias & fairness, use cases out of scope); `docs/report.md` (ATRS Tier 1 + Tier 2); `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- **CI** — switched from `black` to `ruff format`; install via `pip install -e ".[dev]"` instead of `requirements-dev.txt`.

### Fixed
- `_fix_mojibake` SyntaxError — replaced literal curly-quote/en-dash characters with `\uXXXX` Unicode escape sequences.
- `faithfulness_score` always 0 — flattened Gemini list-content (`AIMessage.content` can be `list[{type, text}]`) in `compute_trust`.
- `import re` missing from `agent/graph.py`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-27 (initial hackathon build)

### Added
- Core de-identification pipeline: NHS number, DOB, postcode, email, phone, GMC/NMC, vault-based PERSON redaction, consistent surrogates, date-shift, `assert_clean()`.
- LangGraph ReAct agent: Gemini 2.5 Flash + Tavily public-guidance search.
- Superlinked in-memory NoteIndex for semantic retrieval.
- FastAPI backend (`app/api.py`) with `/health`, `/process`, `/summarise`, `/samples`, `/sample/{id}`.
- Single-file clinician web UI (`app/static/index.html`).
- LangSmith evals: `zero_phi_to_model` (must be 1.0) + `faithfulness`.
- Dockerfile for Hugging Face Spaces deploy (port 7860).
- `NHSEDataScience/synthetic_clinical_notes` dataset integration; baked into Docker image at build time.
